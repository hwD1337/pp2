#Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:

x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()
#Create a class named Student, which will inherit the properties and methods from the Person class:
class Student(Person):
  pass
#Use the Student class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:
x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    #add properties etc.
#When you add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer inherit the parent's __init__() function.

#Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)

#Add a method called welcome to the Student class:
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

  def welcome(self):
    print("Welcome", self.firstname, self.lastname, "to the class of", self.graduationyear)
